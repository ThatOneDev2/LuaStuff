# LuaStuff

Hello there! It seems you've come across my public repository. No, I won't be posting my projects from school there (As I'm HOPING to make it into Comp Sci Projects, but will only update it when I find out) but I will be posting my various projects that I write in LUA (Mostly for Roblox requests. Cringe alert.) here into this specific repository. Feel free to use my basic scripts! (I prefer to use CSharp and Java but oh well!)
